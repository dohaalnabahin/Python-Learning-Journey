        "As we continue thinking about our banking application, we realize that it would be more accurate to assign a balance not to the user directly, but that in the real world, users have accounts, and accounts have balances. This gives us the idea that maybe an account is its own class! But as we stated, it is not completely independent of a class; accounts only exist because users open them.\n",

When a new BankAccount instance is created, if an amount is given, the balance of the account should initially be set to that amount; otherwise, the balance should start at $0. The account should also have an interest rate, saved as a decimal (i.e. 1% would be saved as 0.01), which should be provided upon instantiation. (Hint: when using default values in parameters, the order of parameters matters!)\n",
